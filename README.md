# ClubhouseWeb

A PoC Clubhouse Web Client inspired by [Houseclub](https://github.com/grishka/Houseclub)

**To make it reach the server you need:**
* mimic the User-Agent with `clubhouse/304 (iPhone; iOS 14.4; Scale/2.00)`
* force CORS unblock


##Known Issues:
Currently, can't connect to any of the rooms due to the limitation of the Agora: `CAN_NOT_GET_GATEWAY_SERVER: no active status`
